# The Syntax Error Project ⚡

Yes, this program only prints:
print("Syntax error")

## 🤔 Why?
Because not every project needs to be big and complicated.
Sometimes, one line of code can carry more attitude than 1000 lines.

This is my fun little project where I celebrate the fear of every beginner — the dreaded Syntax Error 😅
